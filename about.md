This blog site is a teaching medium.  I've been a [software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianthomaswebb)
for almost 25 years and have learned a lot that I want to pass on to my children (we homeschool) and to anyone else
who might benefit from my experience.

Server programming (Java), Web Site programming (Javascript and Angular), and infrastructure as code (Ruby and Chef),
all come together in learning pipelines that start easy and end up taking you to a full stack solution to prepare your
for a career like mine, which has been (so far) a _lot_ of fun and pretty lucrative as well.

So welcome.  Let's learn!
