I'm a homeschooling father of 5.  While my wife (may God bless her) does all the heavy, day-to-day lifting in
teaching the kids, I've found that the right place for the father in the Webb family is to enrich and augment
the kids curriculum where I have specific expertise. It's a father's chance to be a direct example for his
children.

My father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and uncles all were in medicine or dentistry.  All did their jobs
well and did well but all of them had the same advice for me for one reason or another:  don't go into medicine.
So I went into software development, for which the timing couldn't have been better (early 1990s). Unlike my
forbearers, I would _highly_ recommend a career in what I do. I _love_ what I do, so much so, I want to teach it.

That's what this blog is about.  It teaches what I know:  C/C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, Angular2, Chef, and Ruby are
the big ones for me (more may pop up here and there). I've got deep expertise in all of these ranging from server-side
service programming, to Web site creation, to mobile programming, to infrastructure automation. I hope that by going through these blog entries, which are a series of lessons about programming, that my children and others can learn what I've
learned.
